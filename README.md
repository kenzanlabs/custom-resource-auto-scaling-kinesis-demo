# custom-resource-auto-scaling-kinesis-demo

### Overview

This sample code is intended to explore real-world usage of AWS's new [Custom Resource Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/07/add-scaling-to-services-you-build-on-aws/) feature, by building on the mock resource stack found in [https://github.com/aws/aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource](https://github.com/aws/aws-auto-scaling-custom-resource) to dynamically increase the shard count of a Kinesis stream in response to high utilization.

### How It Works:
1. A lambda function, CustomResource-Kinesis-Monitor, is scheduled to run at a fixed rate using Cloudwatch Events Schedule Expression.
2. The function is responsible for monitoring a list of streams as defined in [config.py](src/config.py).
   * For each stream it uses the [describe_stream](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/kinesis.html#Kinesis.Client.describe_stream) and [get_metric_statistics](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/cloudwatch.html#CloudWatch.Client.get_metric_statistics) APIs to fetch a) the number of shards in the stream, b) the number of IncomingRecords and c) IncomingBytes since the last function execution.
   * These metrics are used to determine stream utilization against the limits defined in [Kinesis Data Streams Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html) (1 MiB of data per second (including partition keys) or 1,000 records per second for writes)
   * The utilization percentage is written as a custom metric to Cloudwatch.
3. A second lambda function, CustomResource-Kinesis-Scaler, is created whose job it is to scale a kinesis stream in response to a *PATCH* request with the stream name passed in a path parameter and the new desired shard count in the request body.  The real "magic" here is that the lambda is invoked automatically by the Application Auto Scaling component by:
   * Exposing the function via an API Gateway API whose URL is registered as a custom resource with the AWS Auto Scaling component.
   * Creating an application-autoscaling policy that specifies that the Auto Scaling component should invoke the scaling API in response to the average utilization percentage Cloudwatch metric crossing a configured threshold.

### Setup:

#### Resources Created:
1. Two lambda functions:
   * **CustomResource-Kinesis-Monitor** - A function for monitoring the utilization of a configured set of kinesis streams as a function of current shard count, incoming bytes, and incoming messages and writing those values to a custom cloudwatch metric.
   * **CustomResource-Kinesis-Scaler** - A function for scaling a heavily utilized stream by increasing it's shard count.
2. An API Gateway resource which exposes the scaling function to the Auto Scaling component.
3. IAM roles allowing the lambdas access to cloudwatch & kinesis.

### Steps:
1. Create one or more kinesis stream to monitor & scale.
2. Enter the name of the stream in [config.py](src/config.py) configuration file.
   * Out-of-the-box the configuration file is setup to look for a test stream, kinesis-autoscale-test-1.
3. Zip up the python code under the [src](src/) directory & upload to an S3 bucket.
4. Use the aws cli to create the stack.  Be sure to change the region, and S3Bucket and S3Key name parameters as appropriate:

    ```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name CustomResourceKinesisScalerStack \
        --template-body file://./cloudformation/templates/custom-resource-auto-scaling-kinesis-demo-stack.yaml \
        --region us-east-1 \
        --parameters \
            ParameterKey=LambdaCodeS3Bucket,ParameterValue="lambda.scratch.code" \
            ParameterKey=LambdaCodeS3Key,ParameterValue="custom-resource-kinesis-scaler.zip" \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_IAM
    ```
    
5. The creation should only take a few minutes. When complete the command below should return with "StackStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE":

    ```
    aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region us-east-1 --stack-name CustomResourceKinesisScalerStack
    
    {
        "Stacks": [
            {
                "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:{ACCT_ID}:stack/CustomResourceKinesisScalerStack/44c001f0-c8b5-11e8-b575-50faeaabf0d1",
                "StackName": "CustomResourceKinesisScalerStack",
                "Description": "....",
                "StackStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
                "Outputs": [
                    {
                        "OutputKey": "ProdResourceIdPrefix",
                        "OutputValue": "https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/",
                        "Description": "Application Auto Scaling Resource ID prefix for Prod."
                    },
                    {
                        "OutputKey": "S3BucketName",
                        "OutputValue": "customresourcekinesisscalerstack-s3bucket-{EXAMPLE-ID}",
                        "Description": "The location of the CloudTrail logs for API-related event history."
                    }
                ],
            }
        ]
    }    
    ```

6. Note the "OutputValue" response attribute which is the URL of your new custom resource endpoint:

   ```
   "OutputValue": "https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/",
   ```
   
7. At this point you can submit a sample *GET* request to the resource using e.g. Postman & AWS4 requesting signing (configured in the authentication tab).  Be sure to append the name of your test kinesis stream to the URL (e.g. kinesis-autoscale-test-1):

   ```
   https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/kinesis-autoscale-test-1
   ```

8. If successful the response should look like:

   ```
   {"scalingStatus": "Successful", "actualCapacity": 1, "version": "1.0", "scalableTargetDimensionId": "kinesis-autoscale-test-1", "desiredCapacity": 1}
   ```
   
9. Next we register the custom resource URL with the AWS application-autoscaling component.  Copy the URL in the OutputValue attribute with your Kinesis stream name appended and place it in a file called "custom-resource-id.txt":

   ```  
   echo -n "https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/kinesis-autoscale-test-1" > ~/custom-resource-id.txt
   ```
   
   ```
   aws application-autoscaling register-scalable-target --service-namespace custom-resource --scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt --min-capacity 1 --max-capacity 10
   ```
   
10. Finally, we need to create a scaling policy which ties our custom resource endpoint to a cloudwatch alarm.  Our policy is defined in [custom_metric_spec.json](custom_metric_spec.json), which instructs the scaler to target a value of 75% utilization for our target stream.  The MetricName (StreamUtilization) & Namespace (KENZAN/KinesisMonitor) match the metric written in the monitoring lambda.  **Note:** steps 9 and 10 would need to be repeated for each stream name in the list of monitored Kinesis streams in [config.py](src/config.py):
 
    ```
    cat ~/custom_metric_spec.json

    {
       "TargetValue" : 75,
       "CustomizedMetricSpecification" : {
          "MetricName"  : "StreamUtilization",
          "Namespace"   : "KENZAN/KinesisMonitor",
          "Dimensions"  : [
             {
                "Name"  : "StreamName",
                "Value" : "kinesis-autoscale-test-1"
             }
          ],
          "Statistic" : "Average",
          "Unit"      : "Percent"
       }
    }
    ```
    
11. Execute the following command to create the policy:

    ```
    aws application-autoscaling put-scaling-policy --policy-name custom-tt-scaling-policy --policy-type TargetTrackingScaling --service-namespace custom-resource --scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt --target-tracking-scaling-policy-configuration file://./custom_metric_spec.json
    ```
    
### Testing:

1. We can run a batch process to put records on the target stream (a test function, *put_records*, is included in [streams.py](src/streams.py) and allow the monitoring process to observe & record the load, or alternatively can execute:

    ```
    aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name StreamUtilization --namespace "KENZAN/KinesisMonitor" --value 80 --unit Percent --dimensions StreamName=kinesis-autoscale-test-1 
    ```
    
2. In response to the metric crossing the 75% average utilization threshold we should see the following output in response to a describe-scaling command after a few moments have passed:

    ```
    aws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --service-namespace custom-resource --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt --max-results 5
    ```
    
    ```
    {
        "ScalingActivities": [
            {
                "ScalableDimension": "custom-resource:ResourceType:Property", 
                "Description": "Setting desired capacity to 2.", 
                "ResourceId": "https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/kinesis-autoscale-test-1", 
                "Cause": "monitor alarm TargetTracking-https://{EXAMPLE-ID}.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scalableTargetDimensions/kinesis-autoscale-test-1-AlarmHigh-d202dad6-d819-4c2e-8b7c-df184e16c47b in state ALARM triggered policy custom-tt-scaling-policy", 
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

### Limitations:

In practice, there are a number limitations associated with this approach, stemming in part from inherent limitations of the [update_shard_count](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/kinesis.html#Kinesis.Client.update_shard_count) API, specifically:

```
This operation has the following default limits. By default, you cannot do the following:
    Scale more than twice per rolling 24-hour period per stream
    Scale up to more than double your current shard count for a stream
    Scale down below half your current shard count for a stream
    Scale up to more than 500 shards in a stream
    Scale a stream with more than 500 shards down unless the result is less than 500 shards
    Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account
```

The limitation of two scaling operations in a 24-hour period in particular limits the ability to react to swings in traffic.  

For this reason, when creating the scaling function we decided to only ever let increase the number of shards (scale up), as a shard merge operation (scale down) could leave the stream in a state where the two operation limit is met, and the stream cannot be increased in response to a future increase in traffic.

As such, the code functions more as a thought-experiment than a hardened solution, but nevertheless, even in its current state it successfully demonstrates the power and flexability of AWS custom resource auto scaling, and could be used as a jumping point for further exploring more complex use cases.


### Cleaning Up:

The resource created via the installation steps can be cleaned up by executing the following commands:

```
aws application-autoscaling delete-scaling-policy --policy-name custom-tt-scaling-policy --service-namespace custom-resource --scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt

aws application-autoscaling deregister-scalable-target --service-namespace custom-resource --scalable-dimension custom-resource:ResourceType:Property --resource-id file://~/custom-resource-id.txt

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CustomResourceKinesisScalerStack --region us-east-1
```
